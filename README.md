# React Native CLI TypeScript Template

This is a custom [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) template created using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli). It's tailored for quick setup of challenges and projects with TypeScript integration.

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Ensure you've completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) up to the "Creating a new application" step before proceeding.

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

Metro, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native, needs to be started first:

From the root of your project, run:

```bash
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Launch Your Application

Keep Metro running in its own terminal. Open a new terminal at the root of your project and run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:

#### For Android

```bash
yarn android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
yarn ios
```

If set up correctly, your app should soon appear in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator.

### Step 3: Modify Your App

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit as needed.
2. For **Android**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu**.
   For **iOS**: Press <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
